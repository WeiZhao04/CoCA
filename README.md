# CoCA
 A novel method CoCA (consistency of component analysis) is proposed to evaluate the consistency of decomposed components 
 in different model orders (MOs), where consistent components (CCs) are defined as components that could be decomposed 
 consistently in most model orders.
 
 This work is based on the software package of ICASSO (Himberg_et_al_2004) and Tensor-clustering-master (Hu_et_al_2019).
